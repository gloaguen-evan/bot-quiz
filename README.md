# bot-quiz

Bot Twitch to make Multiple Choice Questions directly in the chat.

The question and the choices are displayed in the chat and the viewers can answer directly in the chat by giving the corresponding letter to the choice.

After a set time, the answer is given and the three fastest are announced.

It is possible to set texts in a streaming scene (OBS) to display the question, the choices, the score of the teams and the ranking of the participants.

Upcoming improvement:
- possibility to play without a team
- put a parameter to make writing to files optional
